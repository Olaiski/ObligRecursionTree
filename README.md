# ObligRecursionTree

Mandatory school task/exercise.

(Translation may not be perfect)

Create an application with a graphical interface so that the user can interactively control the size of the tree, 
the angle of the branch from the trunk (previous branch), the size of the trunk in comparison to the rest of the tree. 
You must use recursion to draw the tree, and the user must be able to control the number of levels of recursion. 

Also stop the recursion based on size, e.g. when the branches are less than two pixels long.
Instead of the tree being perfect, all the branches are in place exactly where one expects them, 
you should enter a little random deviation (random) in angles, lengths, and if a branch is displayed at all:
    if (random ...) brach (....);
    
The lower, largest branches should certainly be in place, the smallest outer ones may be missing. 
Let the user interactively control one or more parameters that determine the degree of randomness, 
from everything being in the right place, to there being great variation.
